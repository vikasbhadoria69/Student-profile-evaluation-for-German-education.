            <ul>
                <li>Try to apply for private universities, private universities are as good as government just one have to pay fees.</li>

                    chances will increase. So be positive and start looking for an internship. Data Science is about
                    pratical exposure, internship will help alot. </li>

                    your chances.</li>

            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>Note: You might have less probability because your GPA would be low or maybe you do not have enough
                credits in mentioned subjects. But this should not demotivate you from applying to Germany.

                    of ways your profile can be built stronger.</strong></p>
